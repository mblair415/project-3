## Next Steps
Next steps for my project include:
* Including carrier wave and allowing users to upload images.
* Creating a thumbs up system allowing for user curated content.
* Limit the number of posts appearing on the front page and including a button that will print more posts when clicked.
* Make comments polymorphic allowing comments to belong to either a post or a specific comment. At this point I'll want to add the thumbs up system to comments.
* Set up the posts on post show to alternate between image on left and post contents on the right for post_id % 2 = 0 and image on right and post contents on the left for post_id % 2 != 0.
* Change a couple of remaining buttons created by rails to match the rest of the buttons.
